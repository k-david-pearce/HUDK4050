# Assignment 3
### Cluster Analysis

In Assignment 3 we will be looking at some class motivation data collected from this class two years ago. You will be expected to cluster and visualize the clusters.

The instructions to Assignment 3 are in the Assignment 3.rmd file. Assignments are structured in three parts, in the first part you can just follow along with the code, in the second part you will need to apply the code and in the third part is completely freestyle, apply your new knowledge in a new way. 

**Please complete as much as you can by 5:00pm, 11/05/19**

Once you have finished, commit, push and pull your assignment back to the main branch.

Good luck!
